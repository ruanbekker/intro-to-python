Introduction to Programming with Python, the method that worked for me.

## Things to watch out for

When you start of with programming it looks daunting. But take weightlifting as an example, when you start off, and you can only lift 20KG's, will you be able to lift 200KG's? Probably not.

But if you keep practising everyday with small increments, you will get there. Persistence is key.

## My Approach

I tried a bunch of online courses and I kept getting board and tried to set big goals too fast and that made me bail every single time

What worked for me, was:

- Thought of something that I would like to develop (long-term goal), in my case it was a website to bookmark links and being able to search for them [project](https://github.com/ruanbekker/flask-reminders) 
- Short term goals:
  - Gave myself a month to do simple things (understand what variables are, strings, integers)
  - Then after that do something with those variables, join strings with each other, etc
  - etc
  
Then I stumbled upon a youtube video that was workshop-based, which was a listen-and-do while you watch, and the interactiveness of that helped me a lot, and I am still today thankful for Jessica McKellar as if it wasn't for her, I would probably never start my journey with Python.

She explains everything crisp and clear
